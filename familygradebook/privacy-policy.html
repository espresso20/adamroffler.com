        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Family Gradebook &mdash; Last updated: February 17, 2026</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>The short version:</strong> Family Gradebook does not collect, store, or share any of your personal data. Everything stays on your device and in your private iCloud account.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Family Gradebook ("the App") is a homeschool gradebook tool that helps families track students, courses, grades, and attendance. The App is designed with privacy as a core principle — your data belongs to you and only you.</p>

        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>All data you enter into the App — including student names, courses, grades, attendance records, and settings — is stored in one or both of the following locations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>On your device</strong> — in the App's private, sandboxed storage area that no other app can access.</li>
            <li><strong>In your personal iCloud account</strong> — if you have iCloud enabled on your device, the App may sync data through Apple's CloudKit service. This data is stored in your private iCloud container and is encrypted by Apple. We have no ability to access, read, or view this data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
        <p><strong>None.</strong> The App does not collect, transmit, or store any data on external servers. We do not have a backend, database, or any server infrastructure. There is no account creation, no sign-up, and no login.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, tracking, or data collection services. The only external service involved is Apple's iCloud (CloudKit), which is governed by <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>To be explicit, the App does <strong>not</strong> collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Names, email addresses, or contact information</li>
            <li>Location data</li>
            <li>Device identifiers or advertising IDs</li>
            <li>Usage analytics or behavioral data</li>
            <li>Crash reports or diagnostics (unless you opt in through Apple's own settings)</li>
            <li>Photos, files, or media</li>
            <li>Any data from children or minors</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Family Gradebook is a <strong>parental tool</strong> designed for use by parents and guardians to manage their children's educational records. The App is not directed at children and is not intended to be used by children. Children's information (such as names, grade levels, and academic records) is entered and managed solely by the parent or guardian. This data is stored only on the parent's device and in their private iCloud account — it is never transmitted to us, and we never have actual knowledge of or access to any child's information.</p>
        <p>The App complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and similar regulations. Because all data remains entirely on-device or in the user's private iCloud container, and no information is ever collected, transmitted to, or accessible by the developer, there is no collection of children's personal information as defined by COPPA.</p>

        <h2>Data Export and Backup</h2>
        <p>The App includes a feature to export your data as a JSON file and import it back. This file is created locally on your device and shared only through the means you choose (e.g., AirDrop, Files, email). We never receive or process these exports.</p>

        <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
        <p>You can delete all data at any time through the App's Settings &gt; Data Management &gt; Clear All Data option. Since we do not store any data externally, deletion from your device and iCloud is complete and permanent. If you delete the App, all local data is automatically removed by the operating system.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>Your data benefits from Apple's built-in security measures:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>On-device data is protected by iOS/macOS sandboxing and device encryption</li>
            <li>iCloud data is encrypted in transit and at rest by Apple</li>
            <li>No network requests are made by the App itself — there is no attack surface for data interception</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Educational Records (FERPA)</h2>
        <p>The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) applies to educational institutions that receive federal funding. As a personal homeschool management tool, Family Gradebook is not subject to FERPA. However, the App's privacy-first design — with all data stored locally and never shared with third parties — aligns with the spirit of FERPA's protections for student educational records. Parents retain full ownership and control of their children's academic data at all times.</p>

        <h2>State Privacy Laws</h2>
        <p>Because Family Gradebook collects no personal information whatsoever, the rights granted under state privacy laws — including the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA), and similar state regulations — are satisfied by default. There is no personal data to access, delete, correct, or port, because none is collected.</p>

        <h2>App Store Privacy Labels</h2>
        <p>In accordance with Apple's App Store requirements, Family Gradebook's privacy nutrition label reflects "Data Not Collected" for all categories. This label accurately represents the App's data practices as described in this policy.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>If we make changes to this privacy policy, the updated version will be posted at this URL with a new "Last updated" date. Since the App does not collect email addresses or contact information, we cannot notify you directly — we encourage you to review this page periodically.</p>
